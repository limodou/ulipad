UliPad is highly configuable, but many of them don't has a visual or GUI
operation interface. So here is detail description about it.

As default, config.ini will not be created, untill you change some settings of 
UliPad. So if you want to change the option in config.ini, and there is no such
a file, you can create this file manually in UliPad installed folder or its conf
folder, that's the same. I always create it in UliPad installed folder, because you
can easily find it.

Debug mode
-------------

When you install UliPad, the debug.txt file is created in the UliPad root 
directory.  However, it remains empty until you enable the debug setting, after which 
UliPad outputs a lot of information into debug.txt, including: menu items,
shortcuts, plugins, mixins, etc.  The ``debug`` setting is stored in the  
section of the configuration file as follows::

    [default]
    debug = 1

If ``debug = 1``, debug information is written to debug.txt.  If ``debug = 0`` 
(or unspecified), then there is no debug information. For now, you can switch
the debug mode in Preference Dialog.

Shortcut Keys
------------------

Shortcut keys for menu items are stored in two sections used of the configuration
file. The ``main_hotkey`` section defines shortcuts for the menu bar.  The 
``editor_hotkey`` section defines shortcuts for editing. For example::

    [main_hotkey]
    IDM_FILE_SAVEAS=F12

Each shortcut is defined by specifying the menu-item ID and one or more key names.
Key names include: *shift keys* (``Ctrl``, ``Shift``, ``Alt``, etc.), *function 
keys* (e.g., ``F1``, ``Esc``, ``Tab``, ``Enter``, etc.) and *letter keys* (e.g., 
``A``, etc.).  Each shortcut can contain zero or more shift keys followed by a 
single function key, or one or more shift keys followed by a single letter key.  
Use ``+`` to combine key names, for example: ``Ctrl+A``.

You can use one of the following methods to locate valid entries for the menu-item ID. 

#. Open mixins/Import.py source file, and serach for ``IDM_``, for example::

    (100, 'IDM_FILE_NEW', tr('New') + '\tCtrl+N', wx.ITEM_NORMAL, 
        'OnFileNew', tr('Creates a new document')),
    (105, 'IDM_FILE_NEWMORE', tr('New') + '...', wx.ITEM_NORMAL, 
        None, tr('Creates a new document')),
    (110, 'IDM_FILE_OPEN', tr('Open') + '\tCtrl+O', wx.ITEM_NORMAL, 
        'OnFileOpen', tr('Opens an existing document')),

   The following menu item ID's are found above: ``IDM_FILE_NEW``, ``IDM_FILE_NEWMORE``, 
   ``IDM_FILE_OPEN``. But some menu items may start with ``wx.ID_``, because they
   are stocked IDs also used in UliPad.

    .. note:: Populating debug.txt

        If debug.txt is empty, populate it as follows: 
        
          1.  Enable debug mode.
          2.  Exit and restart UliPad.
          3.  Open debug.txt. 

#. Search for instances of ``[makemenu] makeaccelerator`` in debug.txt to locate
   the various lists of menu ID's with their current shortcuts.  If an menu item 
   has no shortcuts defined, its key-name list is empty (``[]``). 

::

    [ INFO] -- [makemenu] makeaccelerator...
    [ INFO] -- 	IDM_FILE_NEWMORE_NULL []
    [ INFO] -- 	IDM_FILE_NEW [Ctrl+N]
    [ INFO] -- 	IDM_FILE_NEWMORE []
    [ INFO] -- 	IDM_FILE_OPEN [Ctrl+O]
    [ INFO] -- 	IDM_FILE_REOPEN [Ctrl+Shift+O]
    [ INFO] -- 	IDM_FILE_RECENTFILES []

Default Fonts
----------------

If you don't like the default fonts of the Editor, Message Window, or Shell 
Window, you can change them::

    [default]
    editor_font = "fontname"
    editor_fontsize = 10
    message_font = "fontname"
    message_fontsize = 10
    shell_font = "fontname"
    shell_fontsize = 10

And you can also change the caret-line background color::

    [default]
    message_caretlineback = #FF0000

Here the color is represented using hexidecimal ``#XXXXXX``. I think you can also 
use ``red``, ``green``, etc.

Directory-browser File Icons
-------------------------------

UliPad can recognize some files type, and show different icons to these files. 
And if you don't like these icons and want to add some new file icons, you can 
change them in config.ini. For now, UliPad supports: .txt, .ini, .html, .py, 
.pyw, .xml, .bat, .htm.

::

    [fileimages]
    .pyw = file_py.gif
    .c = item.gif
    .ini = file_txt.gif
    .py = file_py.gif
    .txt = file_txt.gif
    .html = file_html.gif
    .xml = file_xml.gif
    .bat = file_txt.gif
    .htm = file_html.gif

If you want to change them, first you should add new image file in $(UliPad)/images folder, the 
image file format could be .gif or .png. Then add like above, the key is suffix of the filename,
and the value is the icon filename.

Ignore files in Directory Browser
------------------------------------

In the default configuration, UliPad ignores some file types in the Directory Browser.

::

    [ignore]
    matches = .*,*.pyc,*.bak,*.ico,*.m3u,

You can extend this list to include other file types.

TODO pattern
----------------

UliPad supports TODO formatting with predefined entries for many files types 
(e.g., ``asp``, ``c``, ``css``, ``djangotmp``, ``fortran``, ``html``, ``java``, 
``js``, ``perl``, ``php``, ``python``, ``rst``, ``ruby``, ``text``, and ``xml``). 
Each entry consists of one or more keys and one or more patterns.  Each key is 
the language lexer name (not the file suffix), and multiple keys are separated 
with a slash (``/``).  Each pattern is a regular expression.  Multple patterns 
are represented using a list format: each pattern delimited with double quotes 
(``"``), and multiple patterns separated with a comma (``,``).  

Entry with multiple keys and a single pattern::

    [todo_pattern]
    python/ruby/perl = ^\s*#\s*[tT][oO][dD][oO]\s+(.*?)$

Sample usage::

    #TODO TEST              Valid
       # todo TEST          Valid
    print aaa #todo test    Invalid

Multiple keys and multiple patterns::

    [todo_pattern]
    c/c++/java = "^\s*//\s*[tT][oO][dD][oO]\s+(.*?)$", "^\s*/\*\s*[tT][oO][dD][oO]\s+(.*?)$"

Sample usage::

    //todo TEST     Valid
      /* todo TEST  Valid
    printf() //todo Invalid

If there is a file type that UliPad doesn't support yet, you can add it::

    [todo_pattern]
    ruby = "^\s*#\s*[tT][oO][dD][oO]\s+(.*?)$"

Note, the following language lexer names require that you install their respective plugins: 
djangotmp (djangoproj plugin), fortran (fortran plugin), and ruby (ruby plugin).

Comment characters
----------------------

You can change the characters that UliPad uses to delimit comments for each file 
type. These characters can be used in Comment and Uncomment menu.  Or press 
``Ctrl+/`` to comment text and press ``Ctrl+\\`` to uncomment text. 

::

    [comment_chars]
    c = //
    python = #
    default = #

Note, the key is not the file suffix, but the language lexer name. But `default` 
is not a language name, just a default value. 

Preferred language
--------------------

UliPad support *i18n*, and when you changing the lanague, UliPad saves the 
selection in config.ini.

::

    [language]
    default = 
    
If default is empty, then UliPad attempts to automatically detect language.  If 
UliPad encounters any problems automatically detecting the language, set the 
default language to English (``en``). 

Python path
-------------------

In order to extend the python path (sys.path) to include a specific directory, 
change the pytonpath setting::

    [default]
    pythonpath = "d:\\",c:/,
    
Directory names should be separated by a comma (``,``).  Individual directory 
names may be delimited using double-quotes (e.g., ``"d:\\"``); names with 
embedded white space must be quoted.
