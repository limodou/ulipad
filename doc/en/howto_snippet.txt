Usage
----------

The CSW provides a convenient way to save snippets of code, and categorize them
into folders and even subfolders of these folders.

The CWS will open in the left panel, by choosing **Tools** -> **Code Snippets** or
**Window** -> **Open Code Snippets Window**. Or click on the
**Open Snippets Window** icon on the tool bar.

To begin to add snippets, you must first create a snippet file, with the
extension ".spt". To do this, open the CWS's context menu by right-clicking
anywhere in the CWS, and choose the **New Snippet File...** menu item. This will
open the New Snippet File dialog. Type a name for the file, e.g.,
CodeSnippets.spt, and click the Save button. You will then see a folder
icon appear at the top of the CWS with the caption "Untitled". This caption
can be changed to something else, but it's not necessary to do so.

Next, create one or more subfolders to this "master folder" by using its
context menu, and choosing **Add Sub Folder**. Do this for each of the main
categories of snippets you think you may want, and assign captions to each
of them. Captions can be easily renamed at any time, and new subfolders
can be added at any time.

The image shows the "master folder", "Snippets", and 3 subfolders, A, B, C.
More than one snippet file can be created--each one represented in the CSW
by a "master folder" icon. However, for simplicity let's stay with just one
snippet file for a while. The snippet file stores on your
hard disk all the information about the CSW--all the folders, nodes, and their
configuration--and is used to create what you see in the CSW. Therefore, the
CSW folders or their snippets are not to be found separately on your hard disk.

Now, let's get a snippet into subfolder A. There are two ways this can be done.

**Method 1**.
    Create a blank node by opening A's context menu and choosing **Add Sub Node**.

Here's what you'll see:

    .. image:: snippet_02.jpg

Then single-click on the new node. This will open the lower panel, with a
"Snippet" tab. Into this either type or paste the snippet you want to keep in
NewNode. Save it by clicking on the Save icon just above the master folder.
You should identify this snippet by assigning its node an appropriate caption.

**Method 2**.
    Create a node by selecting some code or text, dragging it to A and dropping
    it on the A icon. This will create a new node that belongs to A, but this
    node will contain the snippet you dragged. You can see the snippet, and edit
    it if necessary at any time, by double-clicking on the node. The text of the
    snippet will appear in the lower panel. Be sure to save the snippet when
    you have finished with any editing.
    
Continue to add nodes to A by either of the 2 methods. Let's add a couple of
more nodes, give them appropriate labels, and save them:

    .. image:: snippet_03.jpg

Reordering nodes within a folder.

Possibly you would want to have the 3 nodes in the order math.log(), math.pow(),
math.sqrt(). This can be easily done in either of 2 ways:

1. Drag the math.pow() node and drop it on the math.log() node.

or

2. Drag the math.log() node and drop in on the math.pow() node while holding
   down the Shift key.

Either 1 or 2 will result in the reordering you wanted:

    .. image:: snippet_03.jpg

Let's say you decided that math.sqrt() would be more appropriately placed in
category B. Simply drag and drop the math.sqrt() node onto the B icon. The result:

    .. image:: snippet_05.jpg

But now you realize that it would make sense to keep math.sqrt() in both A
and B. So you need to copy math.sqrt() to A. Do this with an ordinary Copy
and Paste: Select math.sqrt(), press Ctrl+C; select math.pow(), press Ctrl+V. Voila!:

    .. image:: snippet_06.jpg

With a little experimentation, you will find that any configuration of folders
and nodes is possible. Of course, subnodes of nodes, and subfolders of nodes
are not possible. But subfolders of subfolders of subfolders of ...  ARE possible:

Should you forget to save any of changes you've made in CSW, whether in a
snippet itself, or by copying, moving, creating or deleting nodes or folders,
when you try to close Ulipad a notice will pop up, "Some changes have been
made to the Code Snippets Window. Do you want to save them?". Click OK.

To delete a folder or node, simply highlight the caption of the folder or node
to be deleted and press the "Delete" key.

To get a snippet from the CSW into a script in the script window, place the
caret (or cursor) at the spot you want to insert the snippet. Hold down the Ctrl
key and click on the snippet's node. That pastes a copy of the snippet at your
chosen spot.

Appendix

Snippet files and the CSW context menu.

There are 7 items concerning snippet files on the CSW context menu


1. **New Snippet File...**

   Opens the New Snippet File dialogue box. Enter a filename for the new snippet
   file, click Save, and a new snippet file will have been created. This will
   show in the CSW as a new master folder captioned "Untitled". (A snippet file
   cannot be deleted through the CSW. Find it in Explorer and delete it there.)
   
2. **Open Snippet File...**

   Opens the Open Snippet File dialogue box. If necessary, navigate to the
   folder containing the snippet file you wish to open. When you double-click
   on the file in the dialogue box, the corresponding master folder will show
   in the CSW.
   
3. **Recent Snippet Files**

   Shows a list of the last snippet files opened, with the most recently
   opened at the top. Clicking on one will open it in CSW, unless it is
   already open.

4. **Save Snippet File**

   Save a snippet file to which changes have been made, by selecting
   it's master folder and choosing "Save Snippet File".

5. **Save All Snippet Files**

   This will save all snippet files whether their master folders are
   selected or not.

6. **Save Snippet File As...**

   Save selected snippet file to another filename.
   
7. **Close Snippet File**

   To close a snippet file, select any folder or node of this snippet file
   and choose Close Snippet File. The master folder (and of course its
   subfolders and nodes) will disappear from the CSW.

Miscellaneous Tips
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. It is convenient to store all snippet files in the same Explorer folder.
   This will permit easy access to all snippet files through the Open Snippet
   File dialogue box, which will open that folder in Explorer every time.

2. It's also convenient to have the master folder icon captions be the same
   as the filenames of their corresponding snippet files. However, even if
   they are different, a mouse hover on a master icon in the CSW will show
   the path and filename of the corresponding snippet file in a tooltip.

3. When a master folder icon shows a small red circle with a white "!"
   inside (see image just below), it means that an as yet unsaved change
   has been made to one of its subfolders or nodes, or to the caption of
   the master folder itself. To save the change, select the master folder
   icon and click on the Save icon above the CSW (or choose Save Snippet
   File on the context menu). Or simply click on the Save All icon. The red
   circle and its "!" will disappear.

4. It is possible to have more than one snippet file open in the CSW. Each open
   snippet file will of course have its corresponding master folder in the CSW.
   Snippet files can be shared among Ulipad users. To use a friend's snippet
   file, just copy it to your harddisk, and open it in the CSW. See item 2 in
   the Appendix.

5. Moving or copying folders and nodes into almost any imaginable configuration
   is easily accomplished. Even moving and copying between separate master
   folders (which represent separate open snippet files).

6. You can change the properties of master folders and snippet nodes through
   their context menus, the Preferences.., item. For a master folder, you can
   change

    .. image:: snippet_08.jpg

Title, Author, Version, Date. and Description

For a snippet node, you can change its syntax highlight language to any supported
by UliPad.

7. Ulipad has a new tool for importing into the CSW the categories and
   snippets made using the old Ulipad tool. If there are any, they can be
   seen by choosing Window -> Open Snippets Window. The new tool is
   snippet_convert.py, in the Ulipad tools folder. To use it, open the
   command prompt window, navigate to the tools folder, and execute the
   command, "python snippet_convert.py". This will create a snippet file,
   out.spt, in the snippets folder in Explorer. Open out.spt in the CSW
   and you should see your old categories as subfolders to a master folder
   captioned "Untitled". The snippets will be nodes of these subfolders.
   At this point you may want to heed 1 and 2 above: Move out.spt to the
   folder containing your other snippet file(s); rename out.spt to, say,
   "MyOldSnippets.spt"; open MyOldSnippets.spt in the CSW; and finally,
   change the "Untitled" caption to "MyOldSnippets". Then close and reopen
   Ulipad to see that the changes have taken place in the CSW.

8. To repeat from above:

    a. To inspect or edit a snippet, double-click on it's node in the CSW. The
       snippet's text will appear in the lower panel.

    b. To paste the text of a snippet, whether or not it is showing in the lower
       panel, hold down the Ctrl key and click on the snippet's node in the CSW.
