Description
=============

Each plugin should be installed in plugins folder, and each plugin
need be a python package, that means each plugin folder need has a
__init__.py file. And there should be a .pin file, for example,
djangoproj.pin. This .pin file will describe the information about the
plugin. The details about the file will list later. Because each
plugin is a python package, so  it can have any file you want, for
example: python module, data files, icon files, etc. A plugin
directory structure could be like::

    plugins
     \---myplugin
         \------myplugin.pin
         \------__init__.py
         \---other files
            ...

If you understand Mixin tech used in UliPad, you will know how to
write a plugin. A plugin really a mixin, but it can be enabled and
disabled outside of the core in UliPad.

If you enabled wizard plugin, you can create an empty plugin by it.
Once you enabled wizard plugin, you'll find a wizard icon in the tool
bar, and you can also find a menu item ([Open Wizard Window]) in
[Window] menu. Executing the wizard, there will be a wizard window
opened in left pane. Then you'll find a "Plugin Template" entry, then
double click on it. It'll pop up a window, then you can input some
information about your plugin, such as:

Plugin name(must), Author, Email, Date, Version, Description,
Homepage, and in the second tab page, you can add information about
the third party module which you used in plugin. If there are no third
party module used, just leave it alone.

Here Plugin name in wizard is important, because UliPad will use it to
create plugin folder, so I suggest that you name your plugin name in
lower case letters, and don't have space and wired characters in the
name.

Details of .pin file
=======================

.pin file just like a ini-like file, the content should be::

       [info]
       author=xxx
       date=xxx
       version=xxx
       description=xxx
       homepage=xxx

author, date, version, description can be blank.

How to write a plugin
========================

Now, if you've created a correct plugin folder and fill in the .pin
file, you 'll see the plugin entry in [Tool] -> [Plugin Manager..]
menu item after you restart the UliPad.

And write plugin code just like write mixin code in UliPad. And I
can't describe it so clearly now, but there are many examples in
plugins and mixins folder. Because almost every functionalities
implementation in UliPad are via mixin and plugin.
